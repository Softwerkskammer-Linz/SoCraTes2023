# TDD vs? Interactive and Literate Programming?

*Contrast these paradigms and discuss how the complement each other.*

## Intro

Observation:
- Both TDD and IP/LP focus on immediate feedback to support the dev process
- IP/LP is very natural in the sense that I can literally translate my thoughts into code
  and see what happens
- TDD wants me to think one step ahead
  - In some domains, this can be really hard
  - Depends on level of abstraction
- For me it is sometimes difficult to smoothly transition between these paradigms

Questions to discuss:
- In what regards are TDD and IP/LP similar and different?
- How can these styles complement each other?
- In which scenarios would you follow which paradigm?
- ...

*Demo on IP and LP*

We agree early on that it is not an either or question but rather
about contrasting the approaches.


## IP/LP

Use cases
* Exploration
  * What to I want?
  * What is relevant?
  * What is it that I really want to implement (later)?
* Support and document learning process

Observations
* Always inside out
* Possibly one-off product that we throw away later
* IP/LP tools like notebooks offer interesting ways to
  understand source code and domains (using animations, sliders, ...)


## TDD

Observations
* Less interactive
* Can use a red test to approximate the expected outcome
  (this bears some similarity to IP)
* Tests can use *documentation language* to describe
  their purpose
* Can be outside-in
* Sometimes TDD is not possible, then
  * Regression test
  * Additional assertions on demand
  * Is it possible to derive properties that we can test against?


## Documentation Language

We observe that *documentation language*, i.e. easy-to-understand
explanations are a common theme in other tools as well because
this is useful.
Examples:
- http://fitnesse.org/
- BDD Test
  - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cucumber_(software)
  - https://cucumber.io/docs/gherkin/step-organization/?lang=java


## Claus' Procedure for "IP/LP to TDD"

Once exploration is over, I want to transition from IP/LP to TDD.
This is how I do it:

1. Derive trusted source code
  * We trust it because we sufficiently inspected and validated results
1. Derive regression tests using artifacts generated by our code
  * Freeze behavior
  * Pave way for automated tests
1. Refactor both source code and interactive inspection tools
1. Continue
