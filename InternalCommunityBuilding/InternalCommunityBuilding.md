# Internal Community Building

This was an open discussion about how to build (internal) developer communities. Here are the notes that were taken directly in the session.

# Ideas for Discussion

* How to create vibrant communities?
* How to foster knowledge exchange outside of meetups?
* What do you value about communities?
* How to make people join in person?
* How to create a safe space where people are not scared of asking and/or speaking?

# Notes

Goal:
* Friendly customers
	* Early access to new features
* Knowledge sharing

Experience:
* People only came for presentation
	* but didn't stay for networking
* Attendance got less and less

* Needed about 3 years to take off
	* now it runs by "itself"
	* presentation but also key notes and people than stay and talk

* (Small company) Internal coding dojo
	* whole day
	* supported by management
	* every 2 weeks
		* changed now to also host additional things, like presentation...

* DevCon once per year
	* From devs for devs
	* Internal and external presentations
* Hackathon
	* with prices
	* but kinda slowed down
* Current work/projects are more important than coder dojo and so on for company/team
	* Create focus groups 
		* are time boxed but also over longer time, e.g. a few months
* Innovation friday
	* e.g. a week a year for "personal" project
* Golden ticket per sprint
	* 1 day to have a look at one topic he wants but he needs to present it to the team afterwards
* Create a community with multiple different topics
	* to ensure there is always a interesting talk/presentation available
* Presentation or interactive workshops?
	* Depends heavily on topic
* People need/prefer different options
	* provide different options so that everybody has a chance
* Hybrid meetings
	* good equipement
		* speaker has his own microphone
		* also in person attendence join the meeting over laptop (only with camera, no microphone)
* Knowledge sharing session every 2 weeks
	* got less over time 
	* however after new promotion from management got better again
		* shows support from management
* Info sessions for multiple teams
	* repeat import deprecation information multiple times
Suggestions:
* good setup + equipment
* regular meetups
	* combine the guild/meetup with other team to have meetups more often
* Size doesn't matter, focus more on how to make the best meetup possible with the current size
* Remote wine and beer tasting :) 
* have food and drinks
* find out why people join the meeting
	* you can't force them to join
* people who "drive" the meetup/guild are needed
* have a code of conduct ;)
* have more "private/fun" meetups
	* focus on socialicing first
* create breakout sessions for discussions
	* or proximity chat
* badge/goodie for presentars/speakers
* use "raise hand" in zoom
* multiple moderators
	* to split responsibilities, e.g. monitor in-person and remote attendees
* use tools like slido for anonymous question
* keep hybrid meetings short
