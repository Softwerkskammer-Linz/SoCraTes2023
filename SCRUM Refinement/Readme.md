Scrum Refinements

- Ideas
  - Separation between functional and technical refinement
    - PO leads functional refinement
    - Requirements Engineer might be valuable counterpart for the PO at the functional refinement
  - Do refinement (details) more on-demand
    - Daily Blocker-Meeting for on-demand detail refinements
  - Epic owner â€“ responsible for making sure the topic is moved forward
  - Technical refinement on-demand when starting working on the story (in-progress status)
    - Mention technical obstacles during the (functional) refinement meeting
- Challenges
  - Missing some aspects
  - Sometimes too much detail
  - Stories too large
    - Breaking down into smaller ones
  - Refining stories too early
    - Next time discussing the topic might lead to different approach
  - When functional requirements and technical aspects are discussed in one meeting, too much time is spent per story
    - Technical refinement is prepared before, and suggestion discussed during the meeting
    - Doing the preparation with (senior) developers might be helpful to include more perspectives
  - Too verbose functional requirements might be lead to many (technically) "false" assumptions
  - Contexts switches when refinements for future tasks
  - Too much Work In Progress items at the same time
