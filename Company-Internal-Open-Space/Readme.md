# Company (internal?) Open Space

by [@haraldreingruber](https://github.com/haraldreingruber)

* Open Space within company: Many did not know it first but it was well received (also online)
  * Participation ~30/100
* There is a great Miro template to use for open spaces
* Target Audience: No clear definition but not only developers
  * Does not have to be restricted
  * You could also host multiple open spaces for various target groups
* Should an open space have a defined topic?
  * E.g. focus on social skills – it would be possible to open a separate track/category for this
  * Possible separation: frontend vs backend
    * That happens automatically during an open space
  * Might be easier to organize within a company if only certain teams are going/targeted
* Company internal vs public open space
  * Who is driving ideas that are created during the open space?
  * Internal: People might be afraid to talk about certain problems (no safe space)
* An open space could be as simple as doing calls (off & on topic)
  * Marketplace: you simply post the topic & time for your call somewhere
  * Open Marketplace is hard if there are not enough people
  * There is less pressure on employees to actually prepare something
  * You can do that each day – you do not have to wait for the next Open Space to happen
  * Motivate people to do a talk about new learnings
  * How much time can you take for topics that are not relevant for the company (yet)?
    * Trust people, practice shows they are not wasting time
  * If you do a talk, will you be the goto support person for everybody on that topic?
  * With a lot of home office, it is hard to keep social interactions up. These calls help in this aspect.
  * No clear structure, max. 1 hour
  * 1 slot per week if somebody wants to do a call
  * Do not worry about if others are interested. Share what you are interested in.
* How to create a safe space where people can talk about anything?
  * Have somebody from higher management that is there and explains that it is a safe space – show clear commitment from the management and be open for concerns (management does not need to be part later on)
  * Do open spaces without management and do presentation to the management later on
  * Company wide show & tell every week: people are reluctant to present because C-levels & management is in there. Would make sense to start with smaller talks and emerge from there.
* It is hard to do open spaces within companies because there are always company goals -\> there has to be an output which puts pressure on the participants
  * Debate vs decision meetings – sometimes it is enough to just discuss
  * Experience: first open space did not really produce output that was presented to management, in the second one this developed naturally
  * Not every topic needs to have a huge outcome -\> over time maybe one topic with a big outcome is enough
  * Outcome can follow after some time has passed (connecting ideas later on)
* How to measure the success of open spaces?
  * Collect action items & ideas. But what to do with them?
* Open Spaces can just be a team building event to make the team more productive (Goal: good experience, something you have learned)
* Innovation/Ship it Days in a Hackaton like format can be a solution as well
  * Can be used for personal development as well
* Practice shows that Innovation Fridays do not really work/fade out
* Experience: Open Space for 5 hours every two months
  * Mainly team building
  * You can talk about whatever you want
  * You can learn about technologies and projects from others
  * Management takes the opportunity to ask for opinions
  * Real magic:
    * communities of practice (e.g. about frontend, backend,…) which are optional
    * working group where one member of each team has to take part (operations & security) – not for innovation/experiments
* Time for projects/ideas is provided by the company
  * Sometimes very successful, sometimes not
* Keeping track of action items can also happen at regular open space events
* Pitch ideas to get feedback from others
* Thursday talks where somebody would present something
  * Worked well in a small company but then stage fright and team internal techtalks came in
* Open Space with customers
  * One company did this and there were many things that were not allowed
  * Guild of customers can work well but is hard with old fashioned customers
* Internal Developer Conferences
  * There is also value in prepared talks
  * More effort for presenters
* Two-day format creates a lot of possibilities
  * Discussions often only happen on the second day. First day is often filled with prepared sessions.
  * Many people that do not want to talk at the first day do that on the second day
