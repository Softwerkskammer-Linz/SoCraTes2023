## Counting SLOC in obscure languages (Thomas A.)

https://pygount.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Context:
- Relative SLOC can be a useful metric to monitor a code base
- For obscure languages, the classical tools did not work

Idea:
- Use a code highlighter/lexer and then only add additional parsers for obscure languages
- Have less SLOC than number of programming languages.


Started as a fun/pet project many years ago and is still alive.
The last years PR were opened and it was interesting to see how it evolves.


## Codefin - Applying Cynefin to Code (Patrick B.)

https://codefin.org/

Proposed by Zurich crafting community and approved by Dave Snowden

Use as a tool to facilitate discussions and review:
- Where are we now?
- What are the tools/processes/... that we use and are these justified?


## TDD for Kids (true story) (Wolfram)

Ten years ago I wanted to show my kids how to program.
As TDD evangelist it has to be TDD!

> Tell Me and I Forget; Teach Me and I May Remember; Involve Me and I Learn

My kids learned about roman numerals at school, I wanted to use that.

But how? Which test framework, which tooling, which?!? (just a joke;)

Inspired by a talk "TDD for managers" I came up with a Google spreadsheet
that serves as test suit and Google app script as language.

Nice!


## Carl Friedrich Gauss, the Pope and Mercedes Benz (Rainer)

Schedule maintenance in the Mercedes Benz museum:
- Cat A must be resolved within two hours
- Cat B within four hours
- Museum open from 9 to 17
  - Except monday (close)
  - Except monday is holiday

How can we implement that?

Then a really funny story followed :)
